# Legend-artist-classification-using-their-artwork


This project includes both back - end (tensorflow-keras, Flask) and front - end (HTML, CSS , JS). the project perform artist classification using any artworks like a if you need to know who created Mona Lisa pantining picture, using the model to predict a name of artist who is created the famous picture, to performs the model using tranfer leanring and pre-trained model from InceptionV3 which collect a lot of trainned layers like a Convolution neural network , flatten, concatination (downloaded using tensorflow keras API) also from a lot of images data input, so we have to adding the last dense layers that is equat by our label that is 20 name of artist, in the Artist Classification.ipynb is a python nootebook can see more detail in this.     

In deploying section, (this web app is a static becuase I don't use a any dynamic database), I use flask framework that is easy and flexible to deploy a python code and result of prediction pass through the HTML site and can run loop of action forever.

You have yo downlaod dataset of images (8k images) for train model 
Images dataset  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y-_fMqTanNTQabBhlQK3JOFisSw5kdqj?usp=sharing

to run the web open app.py by python from terminal or command line , no need to change the name of any just donwload and run it, in images folder, I stored some images for testing.
